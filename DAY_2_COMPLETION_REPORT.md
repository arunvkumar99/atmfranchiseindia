## Risk Assessment

## Team Lead Assessment

**Ravi's Verdict:**

Day 2 was productive but challenging. We made significant progress:
- **Build is now successful** - This is critical
- Each team member contributed individually with their own scripts
- We have a comprehensive testing and validation framework
- 86 more strings fixed today

However, we're not production-ready yet because:
- Many translations are still in English (placeholders)
- Hindi needs to be 100% complete
- UI consistency issues need addressing

**Confidence Level:** 85% (up from 75%)

We need Day 3 to:
1. Complete actual translations (not just keys)
2. Fix remaining components
3. Ensure production readiness

## Documentation Created (Day 2)

1. 5 individual team member scripts
2. 5 result/report JSON files
3. This completion report
4. Fixed build configuration
