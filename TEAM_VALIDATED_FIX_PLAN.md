# Team-Validated Translation Fix Plan
## After Expert Review & Product Prioritization

### ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING
59 components still use `useTranslation()` without namespace. Our previous fix only addressed BecomefranchisePage components.

## 📊 Product Manager's Priority Matrix

### P0 - IMMEDIATE (Fix Now)
**Goal:** Make BecomefranchisePage fully functional
- [x] Fixed namespace for page components
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### P1 - HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Today)
**Goal:** Fix high-traffic pages only
1. **Home Page**
   - Components: Hero, ValuePropsStrip, WhyATMFranchiseIndia
   - Namespace: 'home'
   
2. **SubmitLocation Page**
   - Components: SubmitLocationHero, SubmitLocationSinglePage
   - Namespace: 'forms'

### P2 - MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix This Week)
**Goal:** Fix remaining user-facing pages
- Agent, Influencer, JoinUs pages
- Blog pages
- Product pages

### P3 - LOW PRIORITY (Defer)
**Goal:** Polish and completeness
- Hardcoded text in components
- Missing translation keys
- Utility components

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
1. **NO MASS UPDATES** - Fix incrementally
2. **NO AUTOMATED SCRIPTS** - Manual, careful updates
3. **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** - Keep multi-namespace

## ✅ Validation Protocol (Per Phase)
1. Fix specific components
2. Test those pages in browser
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify translations work
5. Get team sign-off before next phase

## 📝 Component-Namespace Mapping

### Common Components (use 'common')
- Header, Footer, Navigation
- ErrorBoundary, Loaders
- SEOMetaTags

### Page-Specific Components
- Home components → 'home'
- Form components → 'forms'
- Franchise components → 'franchise'
- Product components → 'products'
- Blog components → 'blog'

### Utility Components (use 'common')
- AccessibilityEnhancements
- PerformanceOptimizations
- LanguageSwitcher

## 🔄 Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Git revert to last working commit
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server
4. Document what failed
