---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

1. **Components use `useTranslation()` but don't actually use `t()` for content**
2. **Hardcoded English text everywhere** - especially in legal pages
3. **Wrong namespaces** - Some pages use wrong translation namespace
4. **Fallback to English** - t() function has English fallbacks that are being shown
5. **No actual verification** - Tests only check if useTranslation exists, not if it's used

---

## 📋 CRITICAL ISSUES NEEDING IMMEDIATE FIX

### HIGH PRIORITY (Legal Pages - All in English!):
1. **TermsConditions.tsx** - 95% English content
2. **RefundPolicy.tsx** - 95% English content  
3. **PrivacyPolicy.tsx** - 90% English content
4. **AccessibilityStatement.tsx** - Check needed

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Mixed Content):
5. **SubmitLocation.tsx** - Fix remaining hardcoded text
6. **JoinUsPage.tsx** - All three tabs need fixes
7. **AgentPage.tsx** - Check and fix
8. **InfluencerPage.tsx** - Check and fix

### LOW PRIORITY (Mostly OK):
9. Minor fixes in other pages

---

## ❌ FALSE REPORTING ACCOUNTABILITY

**Previous Claims**: "100% Hindi Coverage Achieved"  
**Actual Reality**: ~30-35% coverage  
**Responsibility**: Team failed to actually check rendered content

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

1. **STOP claiming completion without verification**
2. **Actually replace ALL hardcoded English text with t() calls**
3. **Ensure Hindi translations exist for ALL keys**
4. **Test EACH page in browser, not just check code**
5. **Take screenshots as proof of Hindi content**
