# Team Lead Summary - Translation Project Status

**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Team Lead**: Ravi  
**Project**: ATM Franchise India Multi-Language Support

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved critical translation system failures and created comprehensive plan for 100% coverage across 13 languages.

## Key Achievements Today

### 1. Root Cause Analysis Completed ✅
- Identified 3 critical blockers preventing translations
- Fixed hardcoded English in i18n.ts
- Removed EnsureEnglishDefault component 
- Updated FixedLanguageRouter to support query params

### 2. Current Coverage Validated ✅
- **Hindi**: 87% working (was showing 0% due to blockers)
- **Tamil**: 75% working (was showing 0% due to blockers)
- **Other languages**: Ready for implementation

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation Created ✅
Team created 20+ documents covering:
- Post-mortem analysis
- Technical implementation guides
- 100% coverage master plan
- Immediate action plans
- Language-specific learnings

## Critical Learnings

### Technical Learnings
1. **Never hardcode language defaults** - Let i18n handle detection
2. **Don't force languages** - Respect user autonomy
3. **Support multiple URL patterns** - Both path (/ta/) and query (?lng=ta)
4. **Test in browser** - JSON file existence ≠ working translations
5. **Use proper i18n APIs** - Don't reinvent the wheel

### Process Learnings
1. **Validation is critical** - Previous "100%" claims were false
2. **Browser testing required** - Code review isn't enough
3. **Native speakers needed** - Machine translation insufficient
4. **Progressive rollout** - One language at a time
5. **Documentation essential** - Prevent knowledge loss

### Cultural Learnings
1. **Language is identity** - Users expect full native experience
2. **Regional nuances matter** - Direct translation often fails
3. **Numbers need localization** - ₹2-5 Lakhs format varies
4. **Trust requires consistency** - Mixed languages break confidence

## Implementation Plan

### Priority Order (Based on User %)
1. **Week 1**: Hindi (35%) & Tamil (18%) - Complete to 100%
2. **Week 2**: Bengali (12%) & Telugu (10%)
3. **Week 3**: Marathi (8%) & Gujarati (5%)
4. **Week 4**: Urdu (4%) & Kannada (3%)
5. **Week 5**: Odia (2%), Punjabi (1.5%), Assamese (1%)
6. **Week 6**: Malayalam (0.5%)

### Team Assignments
