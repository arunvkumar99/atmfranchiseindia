1. **Always browser test** - JSON files don't guarantee working translations
2. **Check configuration** - Hardcoded defaults can override everything
3. **Support all patterns** - Both URL paths and query parameters
4. **Use proper APIs** - Let i18next handle language detection
5. **Document with proof** - Screenshots validate claims

## Next Steps

With Hindi and Tamil at 100%, we're ready to proceed with:

### Week 2 Languages
1. **Bengali (bn)** - 12% of users
2. **Telugu (te)** - 10% of users

### Implementation Approach
1. Use the same methodology that worked for Hindi/Tamil
2. Start with translation audit
3. Fix any hardcoded text
4. Add translation keys
5. Browser test thoroughly
6. Document with screenshots
