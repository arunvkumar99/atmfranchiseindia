- Team aligned on approach

### ⚠️ Remaining Risks:
- 357 strings still need fixing
- Hindi translations need completion
- Performance under load unknown
- User acceptance not tested

## Team Lead Assessment

**Ravi's Verdict:**
Day 1 was productive. The team worked well together and we have:
- Clear understanding of the problem (477 strings, not 320)
- Solid architecture in place
- Good test coverage
- Clear plan for Day 2

We're NOT production ready yet, but we're on track. If Day 2 goes as planned, we'll have:
- 100% of hardcoded strings fixed
- 95%+ translation coverage
- All tests passing
- Production-ready system

**Confidence Level:** 75% (will be 95% after Day 2)

## Documentation Created

1. `TEAM_STAGE_1_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Initial planning
2. `TRANSLATION_KEY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture design
