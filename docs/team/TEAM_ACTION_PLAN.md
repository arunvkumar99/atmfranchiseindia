# 🎯 Team Action Plan for TRUE Hindi Coverage

**Team Lead**: Ravi  
**Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Target**: Achieve ACTUAL 100% Hindi Coverage

---

## 👥 Team Meeting Notes

### Ravi (Team Lead):
"Team, I've personally verified each page. We have been providing false reports. The actual Hindi coverage is only 30-35%. We need to fix this properly."

### Arjun (Frontend Developer):
"I see the issue now. I added `useTranslation` hook but didn't actually replace the hardcoded English content with t() calls. I'll fix all pages properly."

### Dr. Sharma (Linguistic Expert):
"I notice the Hindi translations in JSON files exist but aren't being used. Also, some translations need improvement for legal accuracy."

### Priya (Localization Lead):  
"The namespace confusion is my fault. Some pages use 'common' when they should use specific namespaces like 'terms', 'refund', etc."

### Vikram (QA Engineer):
"I should have caught this. I'll create a proper testing checklist that verifies actual rendered content, not just code."

### Rahul (Backend Developer):
"Our test scripts are flawed. They only check for presence of `useTranslation`, not actual usage. I'll rewrite them."

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Fix Code Pattern
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG (Current):
const { t } = useTranslation('terms');
...
<p>English text here</p>

// ✅ CORRECT (Should be):
const { t } = useTranslation('terms');
...
<p>{t('section.key', 'English fallback')}</p>
```

### Step 2: Add Hindi Translations
```json
// In public/locales/hi/terms.json
{
  "section": {
    "key": "हिंदी अनुवाद यहाँ"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify in Browser
- Change language to Hindi
- Check EVERY section
- No English should be visible (except brand names)
