                You've probably heard the term "passive income" thrown around. It sounds like a dream: making money with little to no effort. But what does it actually mean, and how can you get started?

                  Passive income isn't about getting something for nothing. It's about putting in the work upfront so that you can reap the rewards later with minimal ongoing effort. It's the opposite of your 9-to-5 job, where you only get paid for the hours you actively work. Passive income streams, once set up, can generate money for you 24/7, giving you financial security and the freedom to pursue your passions.
